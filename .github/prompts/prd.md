| Requirement ID | Description                                 | User Story                                                                                                            | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Monitoring Political Figures' Posts         | As a user, I want the system to monitor social media posts by Presidents and PMs of key global economies.            | The system should automatically pull new posts from verified accounts on platforms like Twitter (X) and Truth Social from US, China, India, Russia, and Israel leaders.     |
| FR002          | Monitoring Industry Leaders' Posts          | As a user, I want the system to monitor posts from CEOs of major companies like Tesla, Apple, OpenAI, etc.           | The system should fetch and track posts by selected CEOs and key figures in AI, tech, and finance.                                                                         |
| FR003          | Prioritizing Market-Impacting Posts         | As a user, I want the system to filter for posts that may affect stocks, the economy, or companies.                  | The system should use AI analysis to assign impact relevance scores and prioritize high-risk or market-sensitive content.                                                  |
| FR004          | Real-Time Post Logging                      | As a user, I want every important post to be stored for later reference.                                              | The system should log posts with timestamps, user metadata, and content classification into a searchable database.                                                         |
| FR005          | AI-Powered Post Analysis                    | As a user, I want AI models to analyze the context and implications of posts.                                         | Use Nemotron and DeepSeek APIs to summarize, assess market impact, and provide contextual tagging (e.g., "stock warning," "geopolitical risk").                            |
| FR006          | Alert System for High-Priority Posts        | As a user, I want to receive phone notifications when impactful posts are detected.                                  | Push alerts to the user's phone immediately when a post crosses a relevance threshold or matches specific user-defined criteria.                                           |
| FR007          | Time-Critical Updates                       | As a user, I want insights as soon as a post is made to act quickly.                                                  | End-to-end pipeline should aim for <30 seconds from post detection to alert delivery.                                                                                       |
| FR008          | Custom Watchlists and Filters               | As a user, I want to customize which figures or keywords trigger alerts.                                              | The user should be able to specify watchlists for political leaders, CEOs, keywords (e.g., “interest rate,” “AI regulation”).                                               |
| FR009          | Cross-Referencing with Market Data          | As a user, I want the system to link post insights with related stock or macroeconomic data.                         | Display financial tickers, relevant indices, and recent price movement alongside each high-impact post where applicable.                                                    |
| FR010          | Historical Search & Query Interface         | As a user, I want to search and browse previous influential posts and alerts.                                         | The system should allow filtered search by date, user, topic, and impact tag with pagination and download options.                                                         |
| FR011          | System Architecture and GitHub Repository   | As a developer, I want a clean, modular codebase for easy contributions and deployment.                              | The repository should be organized into modules: `fetchers/`, `analyzers/`, `notifiers/`, `database/`, `frontend/`, with clear documentation and setup scripts.             |
| FR012          | Privacy and Rate Limit Handling             | As a developer, I want the system to respect platform rate limits and privacy regulations.                          | Use official APIs with rate limit handling, retry mechanisms, and comply with data collection policies of Twitter (X), Truth Social, etc.                                 |
| FR013          | Alternative Scraping via Browser Automation | As a developer, I want the system to continue functioning even when APIs are unavailable or restricted.              | If no free or official APIs are available for a platform, the system should fallback to browser automation (e.g., ChromeDriver with Selenium) to simulate user actions and extract relevant post content. |
